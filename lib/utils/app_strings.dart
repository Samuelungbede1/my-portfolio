I am a heartfelt mobile developer who loves learning and experimenting with new technologies as they evolve.

I am always determined to make a novel contribution as an individual plus I love the sweet feeling of working with a team. Currently, I develop scalable Android applications with Kotlin. Some of my skills are Firebase Database, XML, Git workflow, Python for Data wrangling, Java, JavaScript, and TypeScript for front-end. As an active learner and problem solver, Iâ€™m currently working on my react-native skills in order to support and provide solutions for businesses that rely on cross-platform mobile applications to meet the demands of their customers.
